# Snake_game
The history of the Snake game goes back to the 1970's. However, it was the 1980's when the game took on the look that we will be using. It was sold under numerous names and many platforms but probably gained widespread recognition when it was shipped as standard on Nokia mobile phones in the late 1990's.

The game involves controlling a single block or snakehead by turning only left or right by ninety degrees until we manage to eat an apple. When we get the apple, the Snake grows an extra block or body segment.

If, or rather when, the snake bumps into the edge of the screen or accidentally eats himself the game is over. The more apples the snake eats the higher the score.
